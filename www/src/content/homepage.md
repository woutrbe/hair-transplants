faq:
  - q: What factors should I consider when choosing a hair transplant clinic?
    a: Look for qualifications and experience of the surgeon, techniques offered, success stories, reviews, clinic accreditation, and price transparency. A clinic without references is a red flag.
  - q: What is the difference between FUT and FUE hair transplant techniques?
    a: FUT involves removing a strip of scalp to extract follicles, while FUE extracts individual follicles directly from the donor area, leaving minimal scarring.
  - q: How do costs vary between clinics and countries?
    a: Costs depend on the location, surgeon expertise, and procedure type. Clinics in regions like Turkey or India are often more affordable than those in Western countries.
  - q: How can I compare the success rates of different clinics?
    a: Of course. Best would be to check the patient reviews. The amount and the scoring really matters. 
  - q: What additional services do clinics typically offer?
    a: Clinics may provide pre-surgery consultations, post-surgery follow-ups, medication, hair care products, and PRP (Platelet-Rich Plasma) therapy for faster healing.
  - q: Are there clinics that offer non-shaving or unshaven hair transplants?
    a: Yes, some clinics specialize in Micro FUE. Micro FUE does not require shaving the donor or recipient area for a discreet procedure.
  - q: How do I know if I’m a good candidate for a hair transplant?
    a: Suitability depends on the stage of hair loss, donor hair availability, and scalp health. Best way to find out, is by visiting a clinic and ask for an assessment.
  - q: What should I look for in patient reviews or testimonials?
    a: Focus on feedback about the clinic’s professionalism, surgeon expertise, procedure comfort, and long-term results. On top of that, don't forget to check how many reviews they have. 1 review of 5 stars, is obviously less trustworty then 100 reviews of 4.5 stars
  - q: Do clinics offer financing or payment plans for hair transplants?
    a: That's not really clear. After you have done your assessment, you can always ask.
  - q: How can I schedule a consultation with a hair transplant clinic?
    a: Use the "Book a Consultation" button and we will always direct you to the page where you can book a consultations. A lot of the clinics offer both in-person and on-line consultations for international clients.
